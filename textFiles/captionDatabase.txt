Been bad & boujee, how you gone let migo?
Sinatra lifestyle, I’m just being Frank with ya
Like the Republic, I stay with a check
Life is amazing, it is what it should be
Don't stop believin'
No pen, no paper but i’m still drawing attention
Every other night, another movie getting made
Like John, I ain’t Cena thing
If I got any cooler I would freeze to death
Certified lover boy
My name isn’t Harry, but I do have Style
Hopped off the bus, then I hopped in a Porsche
They call me ranch, cause I be dressing
Drip wayy too hard
